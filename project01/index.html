            <h2>Metal Gear Solid</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Hideo Kojima took over the development of the game <i><strong>Metal Gear</strong></i> from a senior associate, shifting its focus from combat to stealth due to hardware limitations, inspired by the film The Great Escape. Released on July 13, 1987, for the MSX2 in Japan and later in Europe, the game features the character Solid Snake, who must stop a nuclear-armed tank in Outer Heaven. <i><strong>Metal Gear</strong></i> is one of the earliest stealth games. An NES port with altered graphics and an incomplete ending was released the same year. Kojima criticized the changes, including poor translation and missing content, which a programmer attributed to a tight three-month deadline and hardware constraints.

            <p class="text">
                In <i><strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong></i>, players control Solid Snake, a retired FOXHOUND soldier on a mission to infiltrate the Shadow Moses nuclear weapons facility, which has been seized by rogue FOXHOUND terrorists threatening a nuclear attack. Snake must rescue hostages, uncover the terrorists' true capabilities, and neutralize the nuclear threat. He discovers the terrorists possess Metal Gear REX, a nuclear-capable bipedal tank, and faces enemies including Revolver Ocelot, Psycho Mantis, Sniper Wolf, Vulcan Raven, and his brother, Liquid Snake. Snake uncovers dark secrets about his past and genetic manipulation, and learns about "The Patriots," a secret organization controlling events. The game concludes with a showdown against Liquid Snake and hints at ongoing battles against powerful forces.

            <h2>Snatcher</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Hideo Kojima's next project, the graphic adventure game <i><strong>Snatcher</strong></i>, was released on November 26, 1988, for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2 in Japan. Kojima wrote and directed the game, initially planning for six chapters but reducing it to two due to development constraints, leaving the story on a cliffhanger. Influenced by cyberpunk and Blade Runner, Snatcher featured a semi-open world design and a cinematic approach, guided by character designer Tomiharu Kinoshita and artist Satoshi Yoshioka. Despite its innovative storytelling, praised by critics like Adrian Chen of The New York Times, the Sega CD port faced expensive and lengthy localization. Snatcher was modestly successful in Japan but failed commercially in the west, later gaining a cult following.

            <p class="text">
                During a break from developing Snatcher due to memory limitations, Hideo Kojima began conceptualizing <i><strong>Policenauts</strong></i>. Frustrated with game development, he wanted more creative control and developed a scripting engine post-Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake (1990) to manage animations and music. Policenauts, initially called Beyond, began development in 1990 and took four years to complete. Released on July 29, 1994, for the PC-9821 in Japan, the game received high praise for its presentation, animation quality, voice acting, and immersive setting. Retrospective reviews have generally been positive, highlighting Policenauts as a stylized, film-influenced work within Kojima's portfolio.
